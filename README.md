# OOP-endterm-projectIn this project we tried to create something similar to banking systems which are exists, like Qiwi and so on. Thus, it was easier to think about the structure of your project. So, at the first time we created Account class in java and made some methods and also at the same time we created Custumer table in pgAdmin. Hence, our next step was to connect database and java project and it wasn.t so hard. After connectiing we also created account table and transaction table to moke realistic effect of the real bank. Our next step it was to create Transaction, Account and Account Service classes to work with transactions. And also while connecting database with java project we created DBconnection class at the same time to connect database by setting password, local host and username. In addition, we create MScreen class to make some functions for our main page with main tasks which are most common ones. Thus, by working with them we need to create a new functions of our project
